In your project repository, include a file cmpt383.txt or cmpt383.md and briefly summarize:

What is the overall goal of the project (i.e. what does it do, or what problem is it solving)?
Which languages did you use, and what parts of the system are implemented in each?
What methods did you use to communicate between languages?
Exactly what steps should be taken to get the project working, after getting your code? [This should start with vagrant up and can include one or two commands to start components after that.]
What features should we be looking for when marking your project?
The purpose of this is not to make you write an essay, just to guide the marking so we don't miss anything important. (There will be many projects, and the TAs are human.)
